# shift-manager
This project was born to satisfy a small need, it is not to be considered as an advanced shift manager.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository, compile and execute the code and connect to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Deployment
I have an instance of the shift-manager running on my Raspberry Pi.
